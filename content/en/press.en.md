## Connecting to the whole of Europe: *via paper*

The *Via Papier* emerges from the current restrictions. Robbers lives in Germany, Busso in
London. Suddenly, the two friends can no longer visit each other and so they had to think
of something. *Via Papier* makes allows to reenact the movements currently impossible in

public space at home. They now take place as a play and thus in the mind, where they connect families, friends and neighbours even across borders.

*Via Papier*: streets made of paper to be printed out and put together in infinite variety. The carefully designed details can be coloured in and they inspire children to complement them, for example by their grandparents‘ house. The *Via Papier* can be put together to form ever new streets and to create ever new games. It encourages making as well as playful implementation of the children‘s own experiences.

*Via Papier* also contributes to those experiences. Some streets show European cities like Rome, Paris or London. If the printed paper sheets are placed next to each other, these places are connected. Thus, a space is created in which cities from all over Europe are as natural as the next bus stop. Like the Roman roads that echo in its name, the *Via Papier* connects Europe - in the game and *via paper*.

The *Via Papier* would not be possible without digital media. It reaches families through social networks and the website [viapapier.eu](https://viapapier.eu/), through which it can be downloaded. The game itself, however, consists of streets made of paper, which are glued together, coloured, folded or even cut up. *Via Papier* demonstrates that digitisation makes connections possible, the realisation of which though continues to take place in the sensual world of experience.

Viva la via - viva paper!
