>Just because we have to stay at home doesnâ€™t mean that we are no longer close to the people who live in our city, in our country and in all of Europe. From paper you can build the roads that connect us, that lead from Berlin to Amsterdam and from Warsaw to Rome. They remind us that everywhere we go there are people sitting in their living rooms, dreaming of other places.
